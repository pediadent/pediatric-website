          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">How to Write a Health Guest Post That Will Get You Published?</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            So you want to <strong>write a health guest post</strong> but don't know where to start? Fear not; we're here to help.
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-6 mb-12">
            <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-6 py-2">
              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Do Your Research</h4>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Before you even start writing, it's important to research and find a publication relevant to your area of expertise. There's no point in writing a health guest post for a website that doesn't accept pitches on health topics.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Once you've found a few potential websites, take some time to read through their previous blog posts to get an idea of what they're looking for in a pitch.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="border-l-4 border-purple-600 pl-6 py-2">
              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Make Your Pitch Stand Out</h4>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Once you've crafted the perfect pitch, it's time to make sure it stands out from the rest.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The best way to do this is to personalize your pitch by addressing the editor by name and taking the time to explain why your article would be a good fit for their website.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Generic pitches are more likely to be ignored, so make sure yours is specific and tailored to the publication you're pitching.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Your headline is what will first grab the editor's attention, so make it count! A good headline should be catchy and accurately reflect the content of your article.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Consider brainstorming a few different headlines before deciding which best represents your article.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Once you have an editor's attention, it's important to deliver on the promise of your headline with compelling content that is well-written and researched.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                If your article is full of fluff or doesn't provide any new information, it's unlikely to be published. Take your time crafting an article that will educate and engage readers from start to finish.
